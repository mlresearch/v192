title: Intelligence: From Definition to Design
abstract: This paper provides a non-technical description of the ideas behind a model
  of intelligence that has been formalized and computerized. These ideas are organized
  into a train of thought consisting of the major design decisions of the model and
  contrasted with the major approaches in the field of artificial intelligence. The
  implications of these decisions are also discussed.
