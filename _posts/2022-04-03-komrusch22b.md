title: Neurosymbolic Learning on Activity Summarization of Video Data
abstract: Neurosymbolic learning systems have been shown to quickly discover how to
  interact with discrete representations of the world. Symbolic learners often allow
  for a higher level of understandability than neural networks which learn feature
  vectors for actions being taken, as seen in modern reinforcement learning systems. Symbolic
  learners excel at learning higher-level concepts, but struggle with certain types
  of generalization. Symbolic learners might benefit in such situations from a learned
  representation of the world. This paper discusses a pipeline that uses state-of-the-art
  object and pose detection neural networks as input to a symbolic learning system. We
  show how the knowledge from the symbolic system can automatically correct object
  and pose data from the neural network and hence provide corrected samples that can
  be used to incrementally train and improve the neural network. We show how symbolic
  learning techniques can improve action detection when given example ground truths
  by humans. We also demonstrate how novel actions that are not recognized by humans
  might be recognized by a learning engine capable of recognizing results and preconditions
  for an action to be valid.
