title: Simultaneous Localization and Active Phenomenon Inference (SLAPI)
abstract: We introduce the problem for a robot to  localize itself, and, simultaneously,
  actively infer the existence and properties of \textit{phenomena} present in its
  surrounding environment: the SLAPI problem. A phenomenon is a representation of
  an entity “as the robot experiences it” through interaction. The SLAPI problem relates
  to the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) problem but differs in that
  it does not aim at constructing a precise map of the environment, and it can apply
  to robots with coarse sensors. We demonstrate a SLAPI algorithm to control a robot
  equipped with omni-directional wheels, an echo-localization sensor, photosensitive
  sensors, and an inertial measurement unit, but no precise sensors like camera, lidar,
  or odometry. As the robot circles around an object, it constructs the phenomenon
  corresponding to this object under the form of the set of the spatially-localized
  control loops of interaction that the object affords to the robot. SLAPI algorithms
  could help design companion robots that mimic intrinsic motivation such as curiosity
  and playfulness. Further studies of the SLAPI problem could improve the scientific
  understanding of how cognitive beings construct knowledge about objects from sensorimotor
  experience of interaction.
