title: Reasoning-Learning Systems Based on Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System Theory
abstract: In this paper a strong motivation for real-time reasoning-learning systems
  based on Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) Theory as an approach to build intelligent
  systems with agency is given. This contains the requirement to work under the Assumption
  of Insufficient Knowledge and Resources which demands open-ended adaptation while
  obeying to strict computational resource restrictions to allow for real-time response. We
  show how this aligns with the phenomenon of intelligence as found in nature, allowing
  for systems which can both react instantly, and plan ahead deliberately dependent
  on implicitly outcome-dependent time pressures. In this context a specific implementation
  design is considered, OpenNARS for Applications (ONA), and how its learning and
  reasoning abilities lead to data-efficient adaptation in novel circumstances in
  various domains, whereby we compare with a reinforcement learning method, Q-Learning,
  in Space Invaders, Pong and a grid robot environment. We will see that both techniques
  perform comparably well for reactive tasks in Markovian environments, while the
  uncertainty reasoner performs better when the Markov property is violated, with
  the additional property that it can plan ahead to exploit task compositionality,
  also taking explicit background knowledge into account.
