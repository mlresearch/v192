title: Hybrid AI for IoT Actionable Insights & Real-Time Data-Driven Networks
abstract: 'Significant increases in industry requirements for network bandwidth are
  seen year upon year. The exponential growth in streaming data is matched by an increase
  in the use of machine learning and deep learning to glean actionable – ideally real-time
  – insights from these data. However, approaches based on artificial neural networks
  (ANNs) are often insufficient in terms of functionality, flexibility, accuracy,
  explainability, and robustness. The demand for new model development and continual
  updating and retraining is outstripping the model generation capacity of data scientists
  and others in the field. This gap between supply and demand for real-time data driven
  insights continues to grow. In this paper we introduce a hybrid AI solution which
  adds several elements into the ML/DL mix, specifically a new self-supervised learning
  mechanism, a knowledge model engineered to include support for machine generated
  ontologies as well as traditional human-generated ontologies, and interfaces to
  symbolic AI systems such as OpenNARS, AERA, ONA, and OpenCog, among other elements. Our
  hybrid AI system enables self-supervised learning of machine-generated ontologies
  from millions of time series, to provide real-time data-driven insights for large-scale
  deployments including data centers and enterprise networks. We also apply the same
  hybrid AI to video analytics use cases. Our preliminary results across all the use
  cases we have attempted to-date are promising although more work is needed to fully
  characterize both the benefits and limitations of our approach. '
