title: Symbolic Guidance for Constructivist Learning by Neural Model
abstract: Deep learning has made impressive strides but still lacks key concepts necessary
  to truly reason and act in the world. In parallel, symbolic learning systems have
  shown success at certain types of abstract reasoning, as demonstrated in the Abstraction
  and Reasoning Challenge by Kaggle. Yet, these symbolic learners are challenged when
  generalizing to data from the analog world. This paper will present and evaluate
  ideas for using symbolic learning concepts to guide learning of a neural network
  in a constructivist way. We aim to show how a neural network with internal feedback
  can be used - somewhat like the brain - to suggest the proper actions to take and
  predict the results of those actions. In other words, the system will create an
  internal model of the world on which it can reason. The neurosymbolic system we
  consider is inspired by the symbolic learning system from Gary Dresher and neural
  network cortical columns as discussed by Jeff Hawkins. The hybrid system aims to
  create a synthesis which can generalize on real-world concepts while also quickly
  learning from few examples as the world changes and prior experience is found to
  be inaccurate.
